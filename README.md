# Guessing a given Persian phrase with Genetic Algorithm



## Project task:

Receive a Persian phrase from the user, for example, "سلام، حالت خوبه؟".

Write a program using genetic algorithms that, starting with incomprehensible and random phrases, the same size as the given phrase, will finally reach this phrase and show it.
As it is clear in the example, the phrase can include punctuation characters and numerical figures in addition to Persian letters and characters.

In each generation, display the closest expression to the target expression and its degree of fitness.
